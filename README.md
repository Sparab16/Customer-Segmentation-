# Customer-Segmentation-
Customer segmentation is the practice of dividing a customer base into groups of individuals that are similar in specific ways relevant to marketing, such as age, gender, interests and spending habits. Companies employing customer segmentation operate under the fact that every customer is different and that their marketing efforts would be better served if they target specific, smaller groups with messages that those consumers would find relevant and lead them to buy something. Companies also hope to gain a deeper understanding of their customers' preferences and needs with the idea of discovering what each segment finds most valuable to more accurately tailor marketing materials toward that segment.

Steps to be followed for making succesfull customer segmentation - 
1. Deciding what data will be collected and how it will be gathered
2. Collecting data and integrating data from various sources
3. Developing methods of data analysis for segmentation
4. Establishing effective communication among relevant business units (such as marketing and customer service) about the segmentation
5. Implementing applications to effectively deal with the data and respond to the information it provides

Here in this project I've worked on Mall datasets and applied K-means clustering algorithm to find distinguished patterns in the customers shopping habbits
